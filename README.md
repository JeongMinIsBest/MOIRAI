This repository contains **MOIRAI**, a project submitted to the  
**2024 Generative AI-based Service Software Development Contest**.
<br/>

## ✏️ Project Overview
- 👩‍💻 **Developers**: Jinyong Park, Suhyeon Yoo, Gibaek Lee, Jeongmin Lim  
- 🗓 **Development Period**: May 9, 2024 – May 31, 2024
<br/>

## 🖥️ Development Environment
- **Framework**: Android SDK  
- **IDE**: Android Studio  
- **Language**: Java  
- **Others**: Open API, Figma  
<br/>

## ✏️ Most Optimal Implementation to Reinforce Academic Instruction
**MOIRAI** is an **AI-powered example problem generation service** designed to **enhance users’ learning effectiveness**.
  
By applying **In-context Learning** to a **well-pretrained Large Language Model (LLM)**, MOIRAI generates example problems tailored to the learning topics specified by the user.
  
This project integrates:
- **Experiential Learning Theory** by *David A. Kolb*
- The **Havruta (Hevruta) learning method** from Jewish educational traditions
  
Through AI-generated problems, users can repeatedly apply learned concepts, validate their understanding in practical contexts, and reinforce theoretical knowledge.
